IMPORTING NEW CARDS:

either:
- paste text into import.txt in a terms-definitions format
- or replace import.txt with a .txt file in that format.

minianki will:
- import your files into the database with the "import" command and prompt you for a delimiter (4-space tab by default)
- refresh the deck with the "init" command. 
do remember to do both "import" and "init" everytime new cards are added into import.txt.

IMPORTING/EXPORTING USER DATA:

simply paste another .userdata subdirectory from your old minianki setup into the main minianki directory of your new minianki setup. 
the .userdata subdirectory contains data such as cards (with or without scheduling) and learning variables (preferences). see README.md for more.
