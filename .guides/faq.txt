how does the algorithm work in minianki?
the minianki algorithm is similar to anki's algorithm without certain features. however, we aim to implement most if not all features of anki in minianki (other than features that the terminal does not support) by v1. see the wiki (https://github.com/shuu-wasseo/minianki/wiki) for more information.

can i have subdecks/media in minianki?
we are planning to implement subdecks and media in minianki 1.4 and 2 respectively. see the wiki (https://github.com/shuu-wasseo/minianki/wiki/future-extensions) for more information.
