how does the algorithm work in minianki?
the minianki algorithm is similar to anki's algorithm without certain features. however, we aim to implement most if not all features of anki in minianki (other than features that the terminal does not support) by v1. see the wiki (https://github.com/shuu-wasseo/minianki/wiki) for more information.

can i have subdecks in minianki?
minianki currently does not support subdecks, but we are currently working to implement these in upcoming versions.

can i have media in my minianki flashcards?
while this is a prominent feature of anki, minianki does not currently support media and we are not planning to implement media support anytime soon.
